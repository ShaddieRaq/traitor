Phase 4.1.2 API Integration Tests: Trade Execution Endpoints

DISABLED: This entire test file previously placed REAL TRADES on Coinbase and contaminated the database.

Original purpose: End-to-end testing of trade execution API endpoints.
Disabled reason: Real trade execution causing database contamination with fake large trades.

This file has been completely disabled to prevent further database contamination.
All tests that place real trades have been removed for safety.

# All other test functions from this file have been removed to prevent
# accidental execution of real trading functionality.
#
# REMOVED DANGEROUS FUNCTIONALITY:
# - Real trade execution via /trades/execute endpoint
# - Actual Coinbase order placement
# - Database contamination with large fake trades
# - Position reconciliation affecting production data
#
# For safe testing of trading functionality:
# 1. Use mock mode explicitly (TRADING_MODE=mock)
# 2. Create unit tests that never place real orders
# 3. Use test databases separate from production
# 4. Validate against sandbox/test environments only
#
# This file previously placed real $5 trades on Coinbase which caused
# database contamination and required emergency cleanup.
