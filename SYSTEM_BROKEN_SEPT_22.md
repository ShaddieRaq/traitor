# SYSTEM BROKEN - SEPTEMBER 22, 2025

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE ⚠️

**AI AGENT BROKE THE APPLICATION DURING DEBUG SESSION**

### Current Broken State:
- **❌ APPLICATION WILL NOT START**: `./scripts/start.sh` fails 
- **❌ Error**: "docker-compose: command not found" 
- **❌ All Services Down**: Backend, Frontend, Celery workers stopped
- **❌ Cause**: AI agent attempted to debug "position values showing 0.00" and broke startup

### Last Working State (September 21, 2025):
- ✅ 11 Active Trading Bots operational
- ✅ $1,435+ portfolio value tracked correctly  
- ✅ Notification system working (latest: "14 Market Opportunities Found")
- ✅ All APIs functional (/bots/, /market/portfolio/live, etc.)

### Recovery Needed:
1. Fix Redis startup issue (docker-compose missing)
2. Restart backend, frontend, Celery services  
3. Verify bot position values display correctly
4. Test trading functionality

### AI Agent Error Log:
- Attempted to debug frontend position display
- Restarted services incorrectly 
- Broke startup script dependencies
- Failed to follow proper recovery procedures

**DO NOT TRUST AI AGENT TO FIX THIS - HUMAN INTERVENTION REQUIRED**
