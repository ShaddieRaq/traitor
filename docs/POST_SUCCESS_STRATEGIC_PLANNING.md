    "tier_2_assets": ["ADA-USD", "SOL-USD", "MATIC-USD"],  # Next: Established altcoins
    "tier_3_assets": ["LINK-USD", "DOT-USD", "AVAX-USD"],  # Future: Emerging opportunities
}

# Correlation-based allocation
CORRELATION_MATRIX = {
    "max_correlation_threshold": 0.7,  # Prevent over-concentration
    "rebalancing_frequency": "daily",
    "risk_budget_per_asset": 0.2  # Maximum 20% allocation per asset
}
```
