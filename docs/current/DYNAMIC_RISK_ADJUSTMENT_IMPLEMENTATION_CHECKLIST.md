# Dynamic Risk Adjustment - Implementation Checklist
## September 21, 2025

### ðŸŽ¯ **Ready to Implement**

Based on your 24-hour production test analysis (+$381.67 profit), we have documented the **Dynamic Risk Adjustment Framework** and are ready to begin implementation.

### âœ… **Completed**
- [x] **Performance analysis** of current bot behavior
- [x] **Framework design** with risk calculation formula
- [x] **Documentation created** and added to project index
- [x] **Technical specification** defined

### ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Data Collection Enhancement** 
- [ ] Add `current_risk_multiplier` field to bots table
- [ ] Add `last_risk_calculation` timestamp field  
- [ ] Add `last_50_trades_pnl` tracking field
- [ ] Implement rolling P&L calculation for last 50 trades
- [ ] Create `RiskAdjustmentService` class

#### **Phase 2: Position Sizing Integration**
- [ ] Modify position sizing logic to use risk multiplier
- [ ] Add safety bounds (0.2x to 3.0x range)
- [ ] Integrate with existing trading execution
- [ ] Update bot status API to show risk multipliers

#### **Phase 3: Real-time Adjustment**
- [ ] Implement automatic recalculation (every 10 trades/1 hour)
- [ ] Add risk adjustment logging
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard for risk multipliers
- [ ] Test with paper trading first

#### **Phase 4: Production Deployment**
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Monitor performance impact
- [ ] Compare results vs static sizing
- [ ] Refine multiplier formula based on results

### ðŸ”§ **Key Implementation Details**

**Risk Calculation Formula:**
```python
# Signal heavily weighted (2x), confidence lightly weighted (0.5x)
signal_component = min(bot.signal_strength * 2.0, 2.0)
confidence_component = bot.confidence * 0.5
performance_multiplier = 1.0 + (recent_50_trade_avg_pnl * 10)
risk_multiplier = (signal_component + confidence_component) * performance_multiplier
return max(0.2, min(3.0, risk_multiplier))  # Bounded 0.2x to 3.0x
```

**Expected Results:**
- **AVNT** (current 0.92 signal): 3.0x position sizing
- **ETH** (current 0.43 signal, 0.21 confidence): 0.3x position sizing
- **Automatic adaptation** without manual intervention

### ðŸŽ¯ **Next Action**

Ready to start **Phase 1** when you give the go-ahead. The framework is fully documented and the implementation path is clear.

**Estimated Implementation Time:**
- Phase 1: 2-3 hours
- Phase 2: 3-4 hours  
- Phase 3: 2-3 hours
- Phase 4: 1-2 hours + monitoring

**Total: ~8-12 hours** for complete implementation and testing.

**Status**: Ready to Begin  
**Priority**: High (profit optimization)  
**Risk**: Low (bounded multipliers + testing phases)
