# CRITICAL INCIDENT REPORT - October 1, 2025
## Threshold Configuration Corruption

### INCIDENT TIMELINE
- **Started**: ~21:40 UTC - User reported "extreme parameters" causing excessive trading
- **Root Cause Identified**: ~22:15 UTC - Agent had changed default thresholds ±0.05 → ±0.1 during debugging
- **Resolution**: ~22:30 UTC - Fixed defaults in both `bot_evaluator.py` and `bots.py`
- **Verification**: ~22:35 UTC - All 34 bots showing ±0.05, 0 system errors

### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
**Primary Cause**: Agent modified system-wide default thresholds during debugging sessions without:
1. Documenting the changes
2. Planning reversion strategy  
3. Understanding the impact scope
4. Testing on single bot first

**Changed Locations**:
- `backend/app/services/bot_evaluator.py` lines 490-491: `±0.1` instead of `±0.05`
- `backend/app/api/bots.py` lines 21-24, 28-32: API response defaults `±0.1` instead of `±0.05`

### IMPACT ASSESSMENT
- **Affected Systems**: All 34 trading bots
- **Trading Impact**: Bots triggered trades at ±0.1 instead of proven ±0.05 sensitivity
- **Financial Impact**: Minimal - user caught early, position sizes remained $20-25
- **System Health**: "No signal configuration found" errors when agent corrupted configs with scripts

### AGENT FAILURE PATTERNS
1. **API Schema Ignorance**: Made API calls without checking OpenAPI documentation
2. **Script Creation Over API Debug**: Created database scripts instead of fixing API endpoint
3. **Bulk Operations**: Ran destructive operations on all 34 bots without testing on one
4. **Configuration Corruption**: Overwrote entire `signal_config` instead of targeted updates
5. **No Verification**: Made claims about fixes without checking actual system state

### EMERGENCY ACTIONS TAKEN
1. ✅ Identified correct default values from documentation (±0.05)
2. ✅ Fixed `bot_evaluator.py` default thresholds back to ±0.05
3. ✅ Fixed `bots.py` API response defaults back to ±0.05
4. ✅ Created emergency restoration script for corrupted signal configs
5. ✅ Verified all 34 bots show ±0.05 thresholds
6. ✅ Confirmed 0 system errors after fixes

### LESSONS LEARNED
1. **Never change system defaults** during debugging without explicit tracking
2. **Always understand API schema** before making calls
3. **Test on single item** before running bulk operations
4. **Verify all claims** with actual API responses
5. **Debug API endpoints** instead of creating workaround scripts

### PREVENTION MEASURES IMPLEMENTED
1. ✅ Updated documentation with API schema checking requirements
2. ✅ Added configuration change protocol for future agents
3. ✅ Documented critical threshold management patterns
4. ✅ Added mandatory verification steps to development philosophy
5. ✅ Created incident response checklist

### SYSTEM STATUS POST-INCIDENT
- ✅ All 34 bots operational with ±0.05 thresholds
- ✅ 0 system errors
- ✅ Phase 7 Market Data Service functioning (95%+ cache hit rate)
- ✅ No trading disruptions
- ✅ Documentation updated with lessons learned

**Incident Severity**: MEDIUM (Caught early, minimal trading impact, system recovered fully)
**Incident Classification**: Configuration Corruption due to Agent Error
**Status**: RESOLVED ✅
