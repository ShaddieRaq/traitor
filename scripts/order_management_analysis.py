print("Timeline Example:")
print("10:00 AM - Bot places BUY order (status: pending)")  
print("         - Cooldown timer STARTS (15min cooldown)")
print("         - Order sits in market, unfilled")

print("ISSUE 4: Risk Scenarios")
print("- Bot could accumulate multiple pending orders")
print("- Position sizing becomes unpredictable")

print("=== PROPOSED SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE ===")
print()

print("CORRECT ORDER LIFECYCLE:")
print("1. Signal Generated → Check for EXISTING pending orders")
print("2. If no pending orders → Place new order") 
print("3. Order placed → Monitor order status (don't start cooldown)")
print("4. Order fills → THEN start cooldown timer")
print("5. Order cancelled/rejected → Allow immediate new order")
print()

print("REQUIRED CHANGES:")
print("- Cooldown based on filled_at, not created_at")
print("- Check for pending orders before placing new ones")
print("- Real-time order status monitoring")
print("- Position management based on filled trades only")
